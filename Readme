Developing Basic web application using frontend & Backend language and a database.
This project uses the MEAN stack:

Mongoose.js (MongoDB): database
Express.js: backend framework
Angular.js: frontend framework
Node.js: runtime &backend  environment
Bcrypt.js: password encryption
Prerequisites
Install Node.js and MongoDB
Install Angular CLI: npm i -g @angular/cli
The structure of the Project 
I've split the login and registration pages out from the angular application in order to secure access to the angular client files, so all front end angular files (including javascript, css, images etc) are only available to authenticated users.

It's also possible to include the login and registration pages within the angular application and allow public access.

The express js application is structured using an MVC-ish pattern, there are controllers and views but rather than models I've gone with a services layer for data access & business logic. The services use mongoskin as the mongodb driver, it's a thin wrapper for the native mongodb driver that provides a simpler interface for performing CRUD operations.

Production mode
npm run prod: run the project with a production bundle listening at localhost:3000

Project Setup
Run the command 'npm install' from the project root folder (where the package.json file is located) to download all node package dependencies.

Then run 'node server.js'  npm start from the same location to start the web server and browse to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
